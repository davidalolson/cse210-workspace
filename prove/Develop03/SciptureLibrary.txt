1 Nephi     3:7
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go 
and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the 
Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall 
prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he 
commandeth them.










Mosiah      2:17
And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that
ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings
ye are only in the service of your God.












Matthew    22:36-39
Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all 
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

This is the first and great commandment.

And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour 
as thyself.






Isaiah     58:13-14
If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of
the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own 
ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:

Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee
to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the
heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
it.






D&C        64:9-11
Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for
he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned
before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.

I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is
required to forgive all men.

And ye ought to say in your heartsâ€”let God judge between me and thee,
and reward thee according to thy deeds.
